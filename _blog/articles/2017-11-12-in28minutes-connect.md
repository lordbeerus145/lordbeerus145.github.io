## Aim

- Give Experts a platform to share their expertise
	- With this platform, experts get the opportunity to (possibly) share your vision, passion and knowledge with our  43,000 subscribers on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/rithustutorials) and 100,000 learners on Udemy (https://github.com/in28minutes/learn#best-selling-courses)
- Create Great Programmers from India
	- There are awesome programmers from India doing great work across the world. However, as a percentage of IT professionals, the number of awesome programmers remains miniscule.
- Promote Online Learning in India
	- We think Online Learning is a great socio economic leveller. Online learning has come a long way in the last few years around the world. However, adoption in India remains slow and we want to increase adoption by bringing online learning at an early stage - college and industry entry level. We belive once you start learning online, it will remain your No 1 choice of learning.
- Give Learners exposure to 
	- Behind the scenes look at experts - stories, lessons, beliefs and vision!
	- What's happening in the industry?
	- How can they adapt?

## Our Beliefs

- We believe in continuous learning. Learn every day and adapt. A day you've not learnt something new is a day wasted! And thats the origin for our name in28Minutes.
- Be passionate about what your do!
- While we are creating great learning experiences with our courses, we think a real mindset change happens only when a learner gets a chance to interact with experts - who are passionate and doing great work.
- As an online instructor, we should engage and care for our students.
